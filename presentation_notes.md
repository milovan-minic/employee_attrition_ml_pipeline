# Job Change Prediction - Presentation Notes
## Technical Interview Presentation (10-15 minutes)

---

## 1. INTRODUCTION (2 minutes)

### Problem Statement
- **Business Goal**: Predict which training candidates are likely to accept job offers
- **Value Proposition**: Reduce training costs, improve quality, targeted recruitment
- **Technical Challenge**: Binary classification with imbalanced data

### Dataset Overview
- **Size**: 11,707 training samples, 2,066 test samples
- **Target**: Binary (0 = Not looking, 1 = Looking for job change)
- **Data Types**: Mostly categorical (nominal, ordinal, binary)
- **Challenge**: Class imbalance (74.9% class 0, 25.1% class 1)

## 2. EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (3 minutes)

### Key Findings
- **Class Imbalance**: 74.9% not looking, 25.1% looking for change
- **Missing Values**: 31.2% missing in company_size, 14.6% in major_discipline
- **Feature Distributions**: 
  - Education levels: Graduate (45%), Masters (25%), High School (20%)
  - Experience: Most candidates have 1-5 years experience
  - Company sizes: Distributed across all categories

### Data Quality Insights
- **Missing Data Strategy**: Mode for categorical, median for numerical
- **Outlier Handling**: Robust scaling for numerical features
- **Feature Relationships**: Strong correlation between training hours and target

## 3. FEATURE ENGINEERING STRATEGY (2 minutes)

### Preprocessing Pipeline
1. **Missing Value Imputation**
   - Categorical: 'Unknown' category
   - Numerical: Median imputation

2. **Feature Creation**
   - Experience → Numerical conversion
   - Company size → Numerical mapping
   - Interaction features (training_experience_ratio)
   - Binary flags (has_relevant_experience)

3. **Encoding & Scaling**
   - Label encoding for categorical variables
   - StandardScaler for numerical features
   - Unseen category handling for test data

### Feature Count
- **Original**: 9 features
- **Engineered**: 15 features
- **Final**: 15 features after preprocessing

## 5. FEATURE IMPORTANCE & BUSINESS INSIGHTS (2 minutes)

### Top 5 Most Important Features
1. **city** - Importance: 30.15 (Geographic location is strongest predictor)
2. **company_size** - Importance: 14.84 (Company size affects job seeking)
3. **training_experience_ratio** - Importance: 8.89 (Training vs experience balance)
4. **experience_numeric** - Importance: 6.08 (Years of experience)
5. **experience** - Importance: 5.84 (Experience category)

### Business Interpretations
- **Geographic Location**: City is the strongest predictor - regional job markets matter
- **Company Size**: Larger companies → more likely to seek change
- **Training Experience Ratio**: Higher ratio → more likely to seek change
- **Experience Level**: Mid-level experience (3-7 years) most likely to seek change
- **Education**: Graduate level candidates more likely to seek change
